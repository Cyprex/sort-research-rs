[Partition]

- Fill both blocks all the time. (double iter core) | Didn't really work
- Speedup remaining element partition (maybe use swap space?)
- Special purpose partition for sizes < 100 (use swap?)
- use bextr + count leading zeros
- block quicksort with read elems to avoid read + write indirection in cyclic permutation 
- bucketize u8 classifications 8 out-of-order 7 out-of-order and then walk through matching pairs and have optimized code for each case. How to do rest, leave leftover for next run like block_quicksort partition?

- Talk about smarter software. Compare results of gcc 4.3 (release of i7-920)
